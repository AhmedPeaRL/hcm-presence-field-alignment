# Full Execution Capacity (Defined)

Full execution capacity does NOT mean:
- the ability to act
- the ability to trigger
- the ability to control

It means:
the absence of structural prevention.

This field does not block execution.
It does not enable it either.

Execution is fully possible
because nothing here interferes.
